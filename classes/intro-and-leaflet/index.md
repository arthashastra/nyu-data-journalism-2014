We'll do normal first-day things, like talk about why weâ€˜re all here and what we want. Class goals and policies, introductions, office hours, grading policies, project overview, configuring our laptops, signing up for tutorial and presenation duty.

Finally, we'll get inspired by some code we see online and use it for a quick demonstration.
